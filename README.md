**Website Plan**

**Project summary**
I have chosen Perspective Design Builds.  https://www.buildwithperspective.com/
I believe Perspective Designs needs a new website because, what is actually done by the company is not fully expressed with its current layout. The main page has nothing of interest for viewers. In addition to that I tested it using; 
Page speed insites, Wave accessibility, and mobile friendly test and it showed that. 
Page load speed performance was in the warning zone, it loaded slow for phones,
a few errors and alerts, with lots of contrast errors using Wave 
I want to accomplish a more eye appealing hero page mostly to draw people in.

**Target audience**
The target audience will be people looking for or thinking about building or renovating a new or older home in the Courtenay / Comox, and surrounding areas region. 

**Call-to-action priorities**
The main goal for people on this website is to see what Perspective Design Builds has done in the past and what they can do for the audience in the future. Leaving them happy with the choice and clicking on one of the ways of contact afterwards.

**Look and feel**

**Mood:** I am going for a clean minimalist approach that is easy on the eyes and updated

**Inspiration:** https://www.wardellbuilders.com/ is an inspiration because the website has a nice flow and dives straight to the point. 
	https://www.harperconstruction.com/ is an inspiration because I like the minimalist ness pleasing layout following a background styled image.











**Colours:** Colours for this page will be of a more earthy tone, primary being  #6A6B83 #008000, neutral colour being #F5F5DC, with the highlight being #000080

**Images:**
Theres is a logo and a couple of the images from some of the projects and profiles could be used.

**Fonts:** 
will be Oswald and Roboto Archivo
